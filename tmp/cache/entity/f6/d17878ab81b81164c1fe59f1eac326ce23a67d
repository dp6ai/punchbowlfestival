But it wasn't long until he returned to a dbe in full flow, playing vinyl only sets which fused together the ethics of deep house together with the upfront excitement of the bass music which dbe is renowned for. As a DJ Yobema's selections are always of the upmost quality and his mixing has become more and more precise as his musical brain expands. </p>
